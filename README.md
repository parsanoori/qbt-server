# One command script to deploy qBittorrent

This is my script to setup qBittorrent server.
I try to keep down my expenses and easily set up and set down my qBittorrent server on ArvanClouds.
Hence I reached a script to do it easily and decided to share it Open Source.

## Setup

1. Download the files to a server.

2. Edit `scipt.sh` and set the `DOMAIN` parameter to match yours.

3. Run the scipt.

```
./script.sh
```

4. Enjoy

## Where to use?

I suggest using it on pay as go service in a country that isn't strict on torrent usage such as ArvanCloud, or any similar service in Netherlands.
